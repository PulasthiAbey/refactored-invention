# Refactored-Invention
This is some of the sample React native applications that I built over the time. Fell free to check these out

## Who Pays The Bill
This is a tiny app that created from React Native application in the sense of having some common sense in the matters of creating.
* This is a small game to find out a random name of giving values.
* Clone the `git clone [LINK]` [LINK](https://github.com/PulasthiAbey/refactored-invention) repository and get the source code and make any changes you like.
* Feel free to `folk` this and make changes to the application.
